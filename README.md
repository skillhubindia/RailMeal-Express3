## Overview

RailMeal Express is a simple, single-page HTML website for a train food delivery service. It allows users to browse a menu, add items to a cart, provide delivery details (train, seat, station), select a payment method, and place orders. The site is designed with a railway-themed color scheme (Red, Yellow, White) and includes sections for homepage, menu, order system, and contact/support.

This project is built entirely in one HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript for simplicity. No external dependencies or servers are required‚Äîjust open the HTML file in any modern web browser to run it locally.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Displays the brand, special offers, and menu highlights.
- **Menu Page**: Lists food items categorized (e.g., Veg Thali, Non-Veg Thali, Snacks, Beverages) with prices and placeholder images.
- **Order System**: Users can add items to a cart, view the total, and place orders with delivery info (train number, seat, station).
- **Payment Gateway**: Simulated selection of UPI, cards, or net banking (no real integration; for demo purposes).
- **Delivery Info**: Users input train details for delivery.
- **Contact/Support**: Provides phone, WhatsApp, and email for support.

## Demo

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the site in action. Here's a quick preview:

- Navigate via the top menu links.
- Add items from the Menu section to the cart.
- Fill in delivery and payment details in the Cart section and click "Place Order" for a confirmation alert.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

No installation or setup is needed since it's a static HTML file.

## Usage

### Running Locally
- Simply double-click `index.html` or open it via your browser's "Open File" option.

### Customizing
- **Brand & Logo**: Edit the `<header>` section in `index.html` to change the name or add a real logo image.
- **Color Theme**: Modify the CSS in the `<style>` tag (e.g., `background-color: #FF0000` for red accents).
- **Menu Items**: Add or edit `.menu-item` divs in the `#menu` section. Update images, descriptions, prices, and the `addToCart` function calls.
- **Stations**: Add more options to the `<select id="station">` in the order form.
- **JavaScript**: The cart and order logic is in the `<script>` tag at the bottom. Extend it for more features like removing items from the cart.

### Limitations
- This is a client-side demo; orders are not actually processed or sent to a server.
- Payment is simulated‚Äîno real gateway integration.
- Images are placeholders from `via.placeholder.com`; replace with actual URLs or local files.
- For production, consider splitting into separate HTML/CSS/JS files, adding backend (e.g., Node.js for real orders), and integrating a payment API.
